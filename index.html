            <p>Alicia Keys was born in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, to Terria Joseph (née Teresa M. Augello), a paralegal
              who was also an occasional actress, and Craig Cook, a flight attendant. Her father is African-American and
              her mother, who is Caucasian, is of Italian and English/Irish/Scottish ancestry. Alicia began taking piano
              lessons at age 7 at her mother's insistence. She proved to be such a prodigy that she was later accepted
              into the prestigious Professional Performance Arts School of Manhattan, where she majored in choir.
              only her musical talent but also her grades proved to be so exceptional that she was allowed to
              graduate, as valedictorian, at age 16. In 1998, she signed with Arista Records, and wrote, produced, and
              recorded
              her own albums.</p>

            <p>Khadja Nin was born in 1959 and raised in Burundi, a small African country squeezed in between two
              gigantic territories, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. She grew up peacefully in a family of
              eight children, where she made her first steps into music.

              “Music was always for fun“, she confesses, though she already wished to be Myriam Makeba. When she turned
              16, she left her family and went to Congo to pursue her studies. At the age of 17, she met her future
              husband and moved with him into the forest, where they ran some lodges for tourists in search of big
              thrills. She also gave birth to her son and thought that for her music was definitely over.</p>

            Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler was born in Madrid, Spain, to Spanish singer Julio Iglesias and
            Spanish-Filipino socialite Isabel Preysler. In 1979, his parents' marriage was annulled. He was eight years
            old when he moved to the U.S., and at the age of 15, secretly began writing music. He studied business
            administration at the University of Miami for a year before he dropped out to pursue a musical career. Five
            years later, on September 25, 1995, he released his first album at 18 years of age. His second album, which
            was recorded in Spanish, was released on January 29, 1997.
